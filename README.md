# ðŸ§  Waste Detection with YOLOv11

This repository contains code to train and evaluate a YOLOv11 object detection model for waste detection using the [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) framework and data sourced from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- âœ… Uses **YOLOv11** architecture (Ultralytics)
- âœ… Dataset integration from **Roboflow**
- âœ… Training and validation workflows
- âœ… Real-time inference on images/videos
- âœ… Export and reuse trained model (`.pt` file)
